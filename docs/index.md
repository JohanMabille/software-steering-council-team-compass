# Software Steering Council Team Compass

This page contains links to the notes from team meetings
with the Software Steering Council community.
For more some more information and links to various
Software Steering Council repositories, see the
[Team Compass README](https://github.com/jupyter/software-steering-council-team-compass).

## Resources

Information about the Jupyter Software Steering Council can be found on the
 [Jupyter Governance website](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html).

## Why have a Team Compass?

This repository helps the Jupyter Software Steering Council set a weekly
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans
- communication and culture of respectful teamwork
- recognitions and team celebrations

## How decisions are made

The Jupyter Software Steering Council follows the
["Decision Making" Guidelines](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making) described in the main Jupyter governance documents.

In short, we'll first seek an informal consensus. If a clear consensus cannot be reached, an active council member can call for a vote. The voting process then follows the guidelines laid out by the [Jupyter Governance model](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html#required-aspects-of-decision-making).

## Code of Conduct

[Jupyter Community's Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).
