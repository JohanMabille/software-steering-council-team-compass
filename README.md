# Software Steering Council team-compass
A repository for team interaction, syncing, and handling [meeting notes](https://github.com/jupyter/software-steering-council-team-compass/issues/2) for
the Jupyter Software Steering Council.

This repository is **NOT** for opening or discussing JEPs. This can be done in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).

## How the Software Steering Council operates

The Software Steering Council (SSC) is an asynchronous-first council. We do our best not to _require_ synchronous meetings with the whole council since we span various timezones and aim to keep a robust record of all communications. To facilitate this style, we organize our work and track in-flight tasks using a [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter/projects/10/views/1).

That said, we recognize that some "synchronous" time is beneficial to grow our relationships on the council and offer a place for the community to meet the council members.

Thus, we host a weekly, public "office hour" where available SSC members gather to review JEPs, refine process, and triage/organize tasks. No decisions should be made in these meetings; rather, it's a place to meet-and-greet, answer questions, and organize ourselves for the coming week.

Finally ,we use two channels for all of our communication:
1. For private discussion, we use a google group, jupyter-software-steering-council@googlegroups.com
2. For public discussion, we use a [team-compass repository](https://github.com/jupyter/software-steering-council-team-compass) on Github.

Anyone is welcome to open an issue or email thread on these two channels to engage the SSC.

## Code of Conduct
As an official part of Project Jupyter, all communication across all
repositories in this organization should adhere to the
[Project Jupyter Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md)
